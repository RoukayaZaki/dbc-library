This section outlines the structured approach taken to implement Design by Contract (DbC) in Dart using `source_gen` and `build_runner`. 

# 1. **Annotation Definitions**

The first step is to define the custom annotations that developers would use to specify contracts. These annotations include:

- **`@Contract`**: Declares class-level invariants.
- **`@Precondition`**: Specifies conditions that must hold true before a method is executed.
- **`@Postcondition`**: Specifies conditions that must hold true after a method is executed.
- **`@Invariant`**: Enforces class-level invariants on methods that don’t have preconditions or postconditions.
- **`@FunctionContract`**: Specifies preconditions and postconditions for standalone functions.

These annotations were implemented as Dart classes with appropriate fields to store conditions and assertion messages. 

```dart
class Contract {
	const Contract([this.invariantAsserts]);
	final Map<String, String>? invariantAsserts;
}
```

```dart
class Precondition {
  const Precondition(this.asserts);
  final Map<String, String> asserts;

}
```

```dart
class Postcondition {
  const Postcondition(this.asserts);
  final Map<String, String> asserts;
}
```

```dart
class FunctionContract {
  const FunctionContract({
    this.preconditions,
    this.postconditions,
  });

  final Map<String, String>? preconditions;
  final Map<String, String>? postconditions;
}

```

# **2. Code Generation Framework**

The implementation relied on the `source_gen` package to automate the generation of public methods and functions that enforce the specified contracts. The process involved parsing annotations, validating elements, extracting contract conditions, and generating contract-enforced method wrappers. A custom `Builder` was integrated into `build_runner` to execute the code generation process and ensure that the generated methods were automatically included in the project during the build phase.

## **2.1. Annotation Parsing**

Two custom generator classes, `ContractGenerator` and `FunctionContractGenerator`, were implemented to process annotations applied to classes, methods, and standalone functions.

•	**`ContractGenerator`** handled elements annotated with `@Contract`, ensuring that contract rules were correctly applied to classes.

•	**`FunctionContractGenerator`** processed elements annotated with `@FunctionContract`, ensuring proper enforcement of function-level contracts.

Each generator overrode the `generateForAnnotatedElement` method, which handled the generation logic for annotated elements.

**Example: Annotation Parsing in FunctionContractGenerator**

```dart
class FunctionContractGenerator extends GeneratorForAnnotation<FunctionContract> {
  @override
  String generateForAnnotatedElement(
      Element element, ConstantReader annotation, BuildStep buildStep) {
    if (element is! FunctionElement) {
      throw InvalidGenerationSourceError(
        'The @FunctionContract annotation can only be applied to functions.',
        element: element,
      );
    }

    // Ensure function is private
    if (!element.name.startsWith('_')) {
      throw InvalidGenerationSourceError(
        'Function should not be declared public.',
        element: element,
      );
    }

    final preconditions = annotation.peek('preconditions')?.mapValue ?? {};
    final postconditions = annotation.peek('postconditions')?.mapValue ?? {};

    return _generateExecutable(
      element,
      preconditions: preconditions,
      postconditions: postconditions,
    );
  }
}
```

## **2.2. Validation of Annotated Elements**

To maintain correctness and prevent misuse of annotations, the implementation enforced strict validation rules:

•	The @Contract annotation could only be applied to **classes**. If used on other elements, an InvalidGenerationSourceError was thrown.

•	The @FunctionContract annotation could only be applied to **functions**. Misuse resulted in an InvalidGenerationSourceError.

•	**All annotated methods and functions were required to be private** (i.e., their names had to start with _). This restriction ensured that public methods were **always** generated automatically, preventing direct access to unverified methods.

**Example: Validation in ContractGenerator**

```dart
class ContractGenerator extends GeneratorForAnnotation<Contract> {
  @override
  String generateForAnnotatedElement(
      Element element, ConstantReader annotation, BuildStep buildStep) {
    if (element is! ClassElement) {
      throw InvalidGenerationSourceError(
        'The @Contract annotation can only be applied to classes.',
        element: element,
      );
    }

    // Ensure all methods are private
    for (var method in element.methods) {
      if (!method.name.startsWith('_')) {
        throw InvalidGenerationSourceError(
          'Method should not be declared public.',
          element: method,
        );
      }
    }

    return _generateClassExtension(element, annotation);
  }
}
```

## **2.3. Extraction of Contract Conditions**

Once elements passed validation, the generator extracted contract-related conditions:

•	**Class-level invariants** were retrieved from the @Contract annotation.

•	**Preconditions and postconditions** for private methods and functions were extracted from their respective annotations using _getAnnotation.

**Example: Extracting Annotations for Preconditions/Postconditions**

```dart
ConstantReader? _getAnnotation(Element element, Type type) {
  for (final metadata in element.metadata) {
    final value = metadata.computeConstantValue();
    if (value?.type?.element?.name == type.toString()) {
      return ConstantReader(value);
    }
  }
  return null;
}
```

## **2.4. Generation of Public Methods and Functions**

For every private method or function annotated with contract-related annotations, the generator produced a corresponding **public** method or function. These public wrappers incorporated contract validation logic to ensure that:

•	**Preconditions** were checked **before** execution.

•	**The original private method was called.**

•	**Postconditions** were checked **after** execution.

•	**Class-level invariants** were verified both **before and after** execution.

**Example: Generating Public Methods**

```dart
String _generateExecutable<T extends ExecutableElement>(
  T executable, {
  Map<DartObject?, DartObject?> preconditions = const {},
  Map<DartObject?, DartObject?> postconditions = const {},
  Map<dynamic, dynamic>? classInvariants = null,
}) {
  final executableBody = '''
    ${executable.returnType} ${executable.name.replaceFirst('_', '')}(${executable.parameters.map((p) => '${p.type} ${p.name}').join(', ')}) ${executable.isAsynchronous ? 'async' : ''} {
      ${classInvariants != null ? _generateChecks(classInvariants) : ''}
      ${_generateChecks(preconditions)}
      final result = ${executable.isAsynchronous ? 'await' : ''} ${executable.name}(${executable.parameters.map((p) => p.name).join(', ')});
      ${_generateChecks(postconditions)}
      ${classInvariants != null ? _generateChecks(classInvariants) : ''}
      return result;
    }
  ''';

  return executableBody;
}
```

This function takes a private method, removes the leading underscore, and wraps it with contract validation logic.

## **2.5. Constructor Preconditions**

Preconditions for **constructors** were handled separately via `_generateConstructorPrecondition`. This method extracted `@Precondition` assertions applied to constructors and generated corresponding checks.

Since constructors cannot be modified directly through extensions, the generator produced standalone validation functions (`_ensure<ConstructorName>()`), which encapsulated constructor-specific precondition checks.

**Example: Generating Constructor Preconditions**

```dart
String? _generateConstructorPrecondition(ClassElement el) {
  if (el.constructors.isEmpty) return null;

  final result = el.constructors.map((constructor) {
    final precondition = _getAnnotation(constructor, Precondition);
    if (precondition == null) return '';

    final preconditions = precondition.peek('asserts')?.mapValue ?? {};

    String name = constructor.name;
    if (name.isNotEmpty) {
      name = constructor.name[0].toUpperCase() + constructor.name.substring(1);
    }

    return '''
      void _ensure${name}() {
        ${_generateChecks(preconditions)}
      }
    ''';
  }).join('\n');

  return result.trim().isEmpty ? null : result;
}
```

## **2.6. Assertion Logic and Error Handling**

To enforce contract conditions at runtime, the generator used assertions:

•	`_generateChecks` constructed assertion logic for **preconditions, postconditions, and invariants**.

•	If a condition was violated, an AssertionError was thrown with the corresponding failure message, providing developers with clear feedback on contract violations.

**Example: Generating Assertion Logic**

```dart
String _generateChecks(Map<dynamic, dynamic> checks) {
  final sb = StringBuffer();
  checks.forEach((condition, message) {
    sb.writeln('''
      if (!(${condition.toStringValue()})) {
        throw AssertionError('${message.toStringValue()}');
      }
    ''');
  });

  return sb.toString();
}
```

# **3. Example Usage**

This section demonstrates how the library can be used to enforce contracts in **real-world scenarios**. The examples showcase both **class-level contracts** and **standalone function contracts**, explaining their purpose and why such assertions are necessary.

## **3.1. Class-Level Contracts**

Consider a simple **Wallet** class that maintains a balance and allows deposits. Since financial transactions require strict validation, we define **invariants**, **preconditions**, and **postconditions** to ensure correctness.

**Example: Ensuring Wallet Consistency**

```dart
@Contract({
  'balance >= 0': 'The balance must never be negative.',
})
class Wallet {
  final int balance;

  Wallet(this.balance);

  @Precondition({
    'amount > 0': 'The deposit amount must be greater than zero.',
  })
  @Postcondition({
    'balance == result': 'The returned balance must match the internal balance.',
  })
  int _deposit(int amount) {
    return balance + amount;
  }
}
```

### **Breakdown of Contract Enforcement**

1.	**Class-Level Invariant (@Contract)**

•	Ensures that the balance **can never be negative**.

•	If an operation ever results in a negative balance, an AssertionError is thrown, preventing invalid states.

2.	**Precondition on _deposit Method (@Precondition)**

•	**Ensures deposits are always positive** (amount > 0).

•	If a user tries to deposit 0 or a negative amount, the contract prevents execution and throws an error.

3.	**Postcondition on _deposit Method (@Postcondition)**

•	**Ensures that the function returns the correct balance** (balance == result).

•	This prevents cases where the function might accidentally modify or return an incorrect value.

### **Why Is This Important?**

•	**Guarantees financial consistency** – a bank balance should never be negative, and deposits must always be valid.

•	**Prevents accidental bugs** – without these checks, an incorrectly implemented function might allow negative deposits or return incorrect balances.

•	**Enforces explicit contracts** – developers can immediately understand the **rules** governing class behavior without relying solely on documentation.

After code generation, the _deposit method is transformed into a **public method** (deposit), which automatically includes contract enforcement.

## **3.2. Standalone Function Contracts**

Contracts are not limited to classes. We can also enforce rules on **standalone functions**, ensuring they meet expectations before and after execution.

**Example: Enforcing Constraints on a Function**

```dart
@FunctionContract(
  preconditions: {
    'value > 0': 'Input value must be greater than zero.',
  },
  postconditions: {
    'result > value': 'The result must be greater than the input value.',
  },
)
int _doubleValue(int value) {
  return value * 2;
}
```

### **Breakdown of Contract Enforcement**

1.	**Precondition (`@FunctionContract.preconditions`)**

•	Ensures that the input value **must be positive** (`value > 0`).

•	Prevents calling `_doubleValue(-5)`, which would return an invalid result.

2.	**Postcondition (`@FunctionContract.postconditions`)**

•	Guarantees that the **output must always be greater than the input** (`result > value`).

•	Prevents cases where a faulty function might return incorrect results (e.g., multiplying by 0 instead of 2).

### **Where Would This Be Used?**

This contract pattern is useful for **utility functions** that must follow strict mathematical or logical rules. Example use cases:

•	**Mathematical computations**: Enforce that functions producing calculated results always follow expected mathematical rules.

•	**Security-sensitive code**: Ensure no invalid or unexpected input passes through.

•	**Performance-critical functions**: Catch logical errors early to prevent expensive debugging later.

Like in the previous example, after **code generation**, the `_doubleValue` function is transformed into a **public method** (`doubleValue`), automatically enforcing these conditions.

### 5. **Testing and Validation**

The implementation was rigorously tested to ensure correctness. Test cases were created to verify:

- The correct generation of public methods and functions.
- The enforcement of preconditions, postconditions, and invariants.
- Proper error handling for contract violations.
